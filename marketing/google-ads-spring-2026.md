## Next Steps

1. **Do you have a Google Ads account?** If not, I can guide you through setup
2. **Do you have Google Analytics on the site?** Need to add tracking
3. **Do you have product photography for display ads?**
4. **Want me to create the landing page?**

---

## Notes

- With a $395 product and $500 budget, you need ~1-2 sales/month to break even
- Consider offering a "Spring discount" (10% off) to improve conversion
- Email capture with "10% off first order" could build your list
- Retargeting is crucial at this price point - people rarely buy $400 jackets on first visit
